This program will define a bunch of functions related to mathtematical
operaters and will eventually prompt the user for two numbers and will 
call fumctions using the users entered parameters

Step 1: Define function that takes in two numebrs and returns the sum
Step 2: Define function that takes in two numbers and returns the product
Step 3: Define function that takes in two numbers and returns the quotient
Step 4: Define function that takes in two numbers and returns the difference
Step 5: Define a finction that takes in two numbers and returns the 
        remainder of the quotient
Step 6: Define function that takes in two numbers and returns the first number
        to the power of the second
Step 7: Define a function that takes in a number and returns the square root
Step 8: Prompt user to enter two numbers
Step 9: Call all of the functions using the user entered parameters 
        and print out the results
Step 10: Write a test function for each function using at least two cases
Step 11: *Bonus* Define a function that returns the larger of the two numbers
